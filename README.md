## Added parenthetics.py
    Interview Challenge: Proper Parenthetics
    My first programming language was Lisp. If you’re at all familiar with it, you’ll probably know that in Lisp there are a lot of parentheses.

    Your assignment is to build a quick Python function incorporating one of this week’s data structures that takes a unicode string (text) as input and returns one of three possible values:

    Return 1 if the string is “open” (there are open parens that are not closed)
    Return 0 if the string is “balanced” (there are an equal number of open and closed parentheses in the string)
    Return -1 if the string is “broken” (a closing parens has not been proceeded by one that opens)
    For the purposes of this assignment, open and closed parens must match. As an example, consider this string:

    ')))((('
    Although there are an equal number of open and closed parens, they are not properly paired. This string is “broken”.
